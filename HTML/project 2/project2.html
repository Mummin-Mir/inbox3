    <h1><u>Zainab Binti Mohammad,</u> </h1><hr>
   <h3>Zainab bint Muhammad (Arabic: زَيْنَب بِنْت مُحَمَّد)‎ (598/599–629 CE) was the eldest <br>
    daughter of the Islamic prophet Muhammad by his first wife Khadijah. </h3>
    <br>
    <h2>Marriage</h2><hr>
   
   <h3> She married her maternal cousin, Abu al-As ibn al-Rabi',<br>
    before December 610,[3]: 313–314 [4]: 21 [5]: 162  and <br>
    Khadija gave her a wedding present of an onyx <br>
    [4]: 22  They had two children, son Ali, who died in <br>
    childhood, and daughter Umamah, who would bear children <br>
    including Hilal or Muhammad al-Awsat.[4]: 21 [5]: 162 [6] <br>
    Zainab became a Muslim soon after Muhammad first declared <br>
    himself a prophet. The Quraysh pressured Abu al-As to divorce <br>
    Zainab, saying they would give him any woman he liked in exchange, <br>
    but Abu al-As said that he did not want any other woman, a stance <br>
    for which Muhammad commended him. Muhammad had no jurisdiction over <br>
    Mecca and therefore could not force them to separate, so they continued <br>
    to live together despite Abu al-As's refusal to convert to Islam. Zainab <br>
    remained in Mecca when the other Muslims following Muhammad migrated to <br></h3>

    <h2> Emigration To Madina</h2><hr>
    <h3><p>Abu al-As was one of the polytheists who was captured at the Battle of Badr <br>
     Zainab sent the money for his ransom, including the onyx necklace. When Muhammad <br>
     saw the necklace, he refused to accept any cash ransom for his son-in-law. He sent <br>
     Abu al-As home, and Abu al-As promised to send Zainab
    to Medina.[3]: 314 [4]: 22 </p></h3>
