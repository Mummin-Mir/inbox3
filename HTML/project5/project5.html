    <H1>Zainab Bint Mohammad</H1> <hr>
    <h3><p>Zainab bint Muhammad (Arabic: زَيْنَب بِنْت مُحَمَّد)‎ (598/599–629 CE) was the eldest daughter of the
       <br> Islamic prophet Muhammad by his first wife Khadijah.</p> </h3>
       <br>
       <H2>Marriage</H2> <hr>
        <h3> <p>She married her maternal cousin, Abu al-As ibn al-Rabi', be fore December 610,[3]: 313–314 [4]: 21 [5]: 162  and <br>
         Khadija gave her a wedding present of an onyx necklace.[4]: 22  They had two children, son Ali, who died in <br>
         childhood, and daughter Umamah, who would bear children, including Hilal or Muhammad al- <br>
         Awsat.[4]: 21 [5]: 162 [6] Zainab became a Muslim soon after Muhammad first declared himself a prophet. The <br>
         Quraysh pressured Abu al-As to divorce Zainab, saying they would give him any woman he liked in <br>
         exchange, but Abu al-As said that he did not want any other woman, a stance for which Muhammad <br>
         commended him. Muhammad had no jurisdiction over Mecca and therefore could not force them to <br>
         separate, so they continued to live together despite Abu al-As's refusal to convert to Islam. <br>
         Zainab remained in Mecca when the other Muslims following Muhammad migrated to Medina</p> </h3>
        <br>
         <H2>Emigration to Madina   </H2> <hr>
         <h3><p>Abu al-As was one of the polytheists who was captured at the Battle of Badr. Zainab sent the money <br>
             for his ransom, including the onyx necklace. When Muhammad saw the necklace, he refused to accept any <br>
             cash ransom for his son-in-law. He sent Abu al-As home, and Abu al-As promised to send Zainab to Medina. <br>
             [3]: 314 [4]: 22  <br>
            Zainab accepted this instruction. About a month after the battle, Zainab's adopted brother, Zayd, arrived <br>
         in Mecca to escort her to Medina. She entered a hawdaj and her brother-in-law, Kinana, led the camel to Zayd in broad daylight. <br>
          The Quraysh perceived this as an unnecessary flaunting of Muhammad's triumph at Badr. A group of them pursued Zainab and overtook her at Dhu Tuwa. <br>
           A man named Habbar ibn Al-Aswad threatened her with his lance[3]: 314–315  and pushed her. She fell out of the hawdaj onto a rock.[5]: 4  Kinana showed the <br>
            arrows in his quiver and threatened to kill anyone who came any closer. Then Abu Sufyan arrived, telling Kinana to put away his bow so that they could <br>
             discuss it rationally. He said that they had no intention of keeping a woman from her father in revenge for Badr, but that it was wrong of Kinana to humiliate <br>
              the Quraysh further by parading her removal in public; he must do it quietly, when the "chatter" had died down. Kinana took Zainab home again. There she suffered a <br>
               miscarriage, losing a great deal of blood, which she attributed to having been assaulted by Habbar.[3]: 314–315  <br>
            A few nights later, Kinana took her quietly to meet Zayd, and he escorted her to Medina.[3]: 315  Anas ibn Malik recalled seeing Zainab in Medina wearing a striped silk <br>
             cloak.[4]: 24 </p></h3>

             <h2>Reunion with Abu al-As</h2>
             <h3><p> Zainab did not see her husband again until September or October 627,[4]: 23  when <br>
                 he entered her house in Medina by night, asking for protection. Muslim raiders had stolen <br>
                  some merchandise that he was keeping in trust for other Quraysh, and he wanted to try to <br>
                   recover it.[3]: 316  The next morning, Zainab sat among the women at dawn prayers and  <br>
                   shouted: "I have given protection to Abu al-As ibn al-Rabi!" As soon as prayers were over, <br>
                    Muhammad confirmed that he had not known anything about it, but "We protect whomever she protects. <br> 
                    "[3]: 317 [4]: 22–23  He told Zainab to treat Abu al-As like a guest. Then he arranged for the Quraysh <br>
                     merchandise to be returned, and Abu al-As took it to its owners in Mecca.[3]: 317  <br>

             <h2>Death</h2> <hr>
             <h3> <p> reconciliation was short-lived, for Zainab died in May or June 629. Her death was attributed <br>
             to complications from the miscarriage that she had suffered in 624.[5]: 4  The women who washed her <br>
              dead body included Umm Ayman, Sawdah and Umm Salama.[4]: 24   </p> </h3>
